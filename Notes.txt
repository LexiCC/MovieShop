Entity Framework (MS)
				 -> Create Database without writing single line of SQL Code
				 -> C# code , Migrations -> 

				 -> Connect to db and get data without writing single line of SQL Code
				 -> Select * from Movies where name like '%Ave%' => 20 records
				 -> LINQ -> 

ADO.NET -> 1

EF 6	-> very very fast


EF Core -> Code First Approach to crtete the DB
		-> Create entities and we apply some rules 
		-> Migrations in EF ->
		
		DbContext -> Represstns the database
		DbSet	-> Represents the table 

1. Nuget and download the packages
2. Keep Connection sting for EF -> Server name, database name

If you are using non-windows machine, like mac or linux or if you are not using Visual Studio Rider
