ADO.NET -> takes lots of time to write 
and Dapper (micro ORM) (StackOverflow) to connet to DB
Select * from Movies where name like '%Ave%' => 20 records
Id, Title, Budget
Mappper (miceo ORM Object Relational Mapping)
MovieCard -> Id, Tile, Budget
db.ExecuteQuery<List<MovieCard>>("Select * from Movies where name like '%Ave%' => 20 records")

Already have database ready -> Northwind, AdventureWorkdsa

Full ORM
Entity Framework (MS)
				 -> Create Database without writing single line of SQL Code
				 -> C# code , Migrations -> 

				 -> Connect to db and get data without writing single line of SQL Code
				 -> Select * from Movies where name like '%Ave%' => 20 records
				 -> LINQ -> 

ADO.NET -> 1
Dapper  -> 2
EF 6	-> very very fast


EF Core -> Code First Approach to crtete the DB
		-> Create entities and we apply some rules 
		-> Migrations in EF ->
		
		DbContext -> Represstns the database
		DbSet	-> Represents the table 

1. Nuget and download the packages
2. Keep Connection sting for EF -> Server name, database name
3. Create a class that represent the table
4. Create a new DbContext class
5. establish ConnectionString with DbContext by injecting from appsettings.json
6. Create new DbSet property for the entity
7. Migrations in side Tools-> Nuget Package Manger Console, always run migrations against project that has DbContext location
8. Always make sure ur migration files have meaningful names
9. Data Annotations (Attributes []) or Fluent API

If you are using non-windows machine, like mac or linux or if you are not using Visual Studio Rider
